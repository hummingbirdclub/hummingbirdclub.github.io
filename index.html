<h3>
The Hummingbird Book Club is a truly wonderful club. Our group tries our best to improve our skills on reading so our future is bright. We as a community always give our members plenty of chances so then we're all comfortable in speaking in front of public. In fact we've been so sucessful our members are always treated with kindness regardless of the problem. Our club is always happy to take new recruits no matter where they come from so we're happy anytime if you want to join.
</h3>

<h3>
Our club was first organized by Grace Yang (who happens to be my mom by the way) who came up with the idea and has been thriving ever sinse. In this book club we choose our own books to share in front our club members or choose a book from a specific topic we chose. We practice our speaking skills as much as we can so we're never afraid of expressing our own opinion. Our club represents our determination and slowly getting progress each meeting. 
</h3>

<h3>
Our members currently are Richard(me),Ashley,Emily,Leon,John,Eric,Andre,Edward,and Kyle. We even designed our own T-shirts! If you join you will be given our very own T-shirt! Get prepared because our meetings could be at any library so keep this in mind for the next time. Our members are always satisfied in this fabulous club.If the book club isn't good enough for you there's a Programming class! Our members there learn the basics of HTML and Javascript to learn how to make a website like I'm hoping to. Our group along in the process also learns how to communicate well with each other in laughing or playing. No members are ever left behind with our great support. Overall our group is progressing into the best team we can be.
